    Use HTTPS to avoid mixed-content blocking when this page is served over HTTPS.
    Added a few useful attributes:
      - loading="lazy" to defer loading until needed
      - allow for commonly required features (adjust as necessary)
      - referrerpolicy to avoid passing the full referrer if desired
    Note: If the remote site sets X-Frame-Options: DENY or X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN (and it's a different origin),
    the site cannot be embedded in an iframe — that is enforced by the remote server and cannot be overridden here.
